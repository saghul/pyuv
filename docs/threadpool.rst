    :param loop: loop object where this handle runs (accessible through :py:attr:`ThreadPool.loop`).

    Many times there are blocking functions which we can't avoid to call. In order to make
    them *feel* asynchronous they can be run in a different thread. It will appear that they
    don't block, but in reality they do, but they don't hog the event loop because they run
    on a different thread.

    .. py:method:: queue_work(work_callback, [after_work_callback])

        :param callable work_callback: Function that will be called in the thread pool.

        :param callable after_work_callback: Function that will be called in the caller thread after
            the given function has run in the thread pool.

            Callback signature: ``after_work_callback(result, exception)``.

        Run the given function in a thread from the `ThreadPool`.
