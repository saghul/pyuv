pyuv is a Python module which provides an interface to libuv.
`libuv <http://github.com/libuv/libuv>`_ is a high performance
asynchronous networking and platform abstraction library.

libuv is built on top of epoll/kequeue/event ports/etc on Unix and
IOCP on Windows systems providing a consistent API on top of them.

pyuv's features:

- Non-blocking TCP sockets
- Non-blocking named pipes
- UDP support (including multicast)
- Timers
- Child process spawning
- Asynchronous DNS resolution (getaddrinfo)
- Asynchronous file system APIs
- High resolution time
- System memory information
- System CPUs information
- Network interfaces information
- Thread pool scheduling
- ANSI escape code controlled TTY
- File system events (inotify style and stat based)
- IPC and TCP socket sharing between processes
- Arbitrary file descriptor polling

Running the test suite
======================

There are several ways of running the test ruite:

- Run the test with the current Python interpreter:

  From the toplevel directory, run: ``nosetests -v``

- Use Tox to run the test suite in several virtualenvs with several interpreters

  From the toplevel directory, run: ``tox`` this will run the test suite
  on several Python versions (you'll need to have them installed beforehand)
