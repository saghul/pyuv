pyuv: Python interface to libuv
===============================

pyuv is a Python module which provides an interface to libuv.
libuv (http://github.com/joyent/libuv) is a high performance
asynchronous networking library, used as the platform layer for
NodeJS (http://nodejs.org).

It’s built on top of liev and libeio on Unix and IOCP on Windows systems
providing a consistent API on top of them.

libuv's features:

 * Non-blocking TCP sockets
 * Non-blocking named pipes
 * UDP
 * Timers
 * Child process spawning
 * Asynchronous DNS via c-ares or uv_getaddrinfo.
 * Asynchronous file system APIs uv_fs_*
 * High resolution time uv_hrtime
 * Current executable path look up uv_exepath
 * Thread pool scheduling uv_queue_work
 * ANSI escape code controlled TTY uv_tty_t
 * File system events Currently supports inotify, ReadDirectoryChangesW
   and kqueue. Event ports in the near future. uv_fs_event_t
 * IPC and socket sharing between processes uv_write2

libuv is written and maintained by Joyent Inc. and contributors.

puyv does not yet wrap all functionality of libuv.
