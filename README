pyuv: Python interface to libuv
===============================

pyuv is a Python module which provides an interface to libuv.
libuv (http://github.com/joyent/libuv) is a high performance
asynchronous networking library, used as the platform layer for
NodeJS (http://nodejs.org).

libuv is written and maintained by Joyent Inc. and contributors.
It’s built on top of libev and libeio on Unix and IOCP on Windows systems
providing a consistent API on top of them.

pyuv's features:

 * Non-blocking TCP sockets
 * Non-blocking named pipes
 * UDP support
 * Timers
 * Child process spawning
 * Asynchronous DNS (gethostbyname, getaddrbyname, getnameinfo, getaddrinfo)
 * Asynchronous file system APIs
 * High resolution time
 * Thread pool scheduling
 * ANSI escape code controlled TTY
 * File system events (initify style)
 * IPC and TCP socket sharing between processes
